# Rhythm Engine
---

In almost every rhythm game players and especially mappers push the game beyond what the game was
initially designed for in order to achieve more stimulating, complex and expressive experiences.

This project aims to create a pointer based rhythm game (similar to osu!) with this in mind.
The goal is to use linear interpolation tools to enable interesting mechanics.
The game will feature a first in class editor with tools inspired by Digital Audio Workstations
to make hyper expressive gameplay creation much easier. Currently with similar things like
osu! storyboards and beatsaber custom levels this is done via scripting which isn't as accessible
as a good gui editor nor as ergonomic to use.
